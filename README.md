# CodeJam
Solutions for Google Code Jam practice questions

Solutions are found in a java class with the same title as the given question. At this point all solutions are for problems explicitly mentioned as good starting points at https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html

Every solution takes a single argument to be run from the commandline, a filename containing the input for the question. The output will take the form of a file [Initials]Output.txt, where XY are the initials of the class.

These solutions have been made as a learning exercise and as practice for the upcoming 2015 google code jam, they are free to be copied, used, and adapted for whatever use you see fit.
